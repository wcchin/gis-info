## About GIS Info

This is just a simple website to store some useful information on the academic events and journals related to GIS or Geography. Data is stored in Github and hosted as Github Pages. 

The website loads JSON data directly from the Github folder using Javascript, then present the data in table format using <a href="https://tabulator.info/" target="_blank">Tabulator</a>. This simplified the process of maintenance and data update.

Most historical data was acquired from <a href="https://github.com/mocnik-science/giscience.net-data/">mocnik-science/giscience.net-data</a> repository---their <a href="www.giscience.net" target="_blank">website</a> is down at the moment, and conference data is updated until 2023.
